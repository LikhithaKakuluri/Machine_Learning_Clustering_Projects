# Machine_Learning_Clustering_Projects
Performed all the clustering algorithms
1) Customer Segmentation Anlaysis Python : Customer Segmentation Analysis with Python (K_Means)
2) Customer Segementation: It contains the segmentations of customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score,It make use of wcss method ,elbow graph and viaualize the various segments of the customer
   (K-Meams)
3) Customer Segementation Techniqyues: Use Clustering Techniques for the any customer dataset using machine learning
   * K-Meams Clustering
   * Affinity Propogation
   * BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)
   * DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
   * Mini-Batch K-Means
   * Mean Shift
   * OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)
   * Spectral Clustering
   * Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
   * Agglomerative Clustering
